# Card Game

## Overview

Welcome to my Card Game project! I will be using the Lua scripting language and Love2D to create a unique card roguelite deckbuiler. My inspiration to start this project comes from my love for roguelikes such as The Binding of Issac, as well as a passion for card games such as Magic the Gathering. Other games such as Slay the Spire, and Balatro have proven to me that this is a popular niche, as well as a viable smaller scale project to tackle with both titles coming from small or single man indie teams.


## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are as follows:
1. Learn the Lua scripting language, as well as learning Love2D and the fundementals of producing games with non-gui engines/frameworks.
2. Develop clean architecture practices, implementing features and systems usually obfuscated in larger engines
3. Launch a final product, practicing; QA testing, Localization, Marketing, Finacials, Publishing and Community Management
4. Deliver an engaging, unique and challenging card roguelite deckbuilding game, that emphasizes the importance of strategy when deciding what build to create.


## Get Involved

I welcome contributions and feedback from the gaming community, developers, and anyone interested. If you'd like to contribute to the project or provide feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me.
